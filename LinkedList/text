static arrays are located on stacks while dynamic arrays are allocated on heaps
vector is a dynamically sized array

in java all arrays are allocated on heaps and we have arraylist which is similar to vector, in java

why we need linkedlinst -
1.  Insertion/Deletion in middle of array is costly
2. Implementation of data structures like queue and dequeue is costly with arrays
