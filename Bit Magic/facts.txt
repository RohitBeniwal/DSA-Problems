x>>y == floor[x/(2*y)]
x<<y == x*2*y   if leading bits are 1 then it is not equivalent to that

in case of signed numbers leading bit represents the sign of the number
2's complement of x= 2^32 - x   //the number -x will be represented as this
so if u will take ~5 where 5 is signed then ~5=-6  // 2^32 -1-5 will be the 2's complement

if we left shift a number we can obtain that by multiplying it with the 2^(left shift)
similarly in right shift we divide with 2^(right shift)
