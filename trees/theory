when you have to represent hierarchy
it is a non linear data structure

nodes which do not have anything below them are called leaf nodes
node below a node is called is called children node
and just above is parent node
the top most node is called root node

degree of a node is defined as the number of children it has
nodes other than leaf nodes are called internal nodes


Binary Tree

have max degree 2
eg- BST,Binary Heap,Segment Tree (for queries)etc.


Tree Traversal-
1.Breadth First (Level Order)
2.Depth  First - 
                    1. Inorder  L root R
                    2. Preorder root L R
                    3. Postorder  L R root
